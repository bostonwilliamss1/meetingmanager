# Overview

This app is a meeting organizer. It has a place where you can see all of your meetings and then you can click on your meeting and then edit the people in there, adjust the time and the theme. 

The purpose of this app was really to help me learn Swift. I was trying to learn the different pieces and how they work together.

# Development Environment

I used XCode as my environment, which is nice because it comes with a simulator.

The language I was using was Swift. Which is iOS developing language.
